Slides and theme for my talk at [WordCamp Montr√©al 2016](https://2016.montreal.wordcamp.org). This repo contains:

- **felinedesignco**: a complete WordPress theme
- **html-site**: the original HTML and CSS template I based my theme on
- **slides.pdf**: my slide deck, with step-by-step guidelines to creating a custom theme

My slide deck is also on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/linnalexandra/dont-fear-the-custom-theme-how-to-build-a-custom-wordpress-theme-with-only-four-files-1).
